**TourWise Vision: Creating a "Wow!" Homepage Experience**

---

## Goal:

Create a lively, emotionally engaging website homepage that captures attention within seconds and inspires curiosity and trust before redirecting users to third-party booking sites like Booking.com, Agoda, or Trip.com.

---

## Core Experience Strategy: "Wow first. Value second. Click third."

### 1. Hero Section with Motion

* Full-width drone video or animated background of Bohol
* Motion-based text entrance (e.g., "You didn‚Äôt plan to find paradise today, but here you are.")
* Subtle pulse or glow on "Start Exploring" CTA
* Optional ambient sound with mute toggle (beach waves, birds)

### 2. Themed Discovery Sections

* **"Under ‚Ç±2000/night, 5-star feel"**
* **"Hidden Resorts Locals Love"**
* **"Best for Couples | Families | Adventures"**
* Each with curated card grids and hover animation

### 3. Resort Cards + Map Interaction (future addition)

* Left: Scrollable resort cards
* Right: Interactive map
* Hovering a card highlights pin on the map
* Clicking a card zooms map to location
* Clicking map pin highlights the card

### 4. Rich Hotel Detail Overlay (before redirect)

* Clicking a card opens a beautifully designed panel:

  * Resort images
  * Description
  * Rating + reviews
  * Local tips: "3 must-try foods nearby"
  * Book buttons: Agoda | Booking.com | Trip.com
* Only redirects after this interaction

### 5. Visual Micro-Interactions

* Resort cards animate on hover
* Scroll-triggered transitions
* Parallax background effect
* Floating hearts or live-notifications (e.g., "Someone just booked in Panglao")
