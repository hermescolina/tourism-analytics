🔑 Enhanced Auto-Escalation Logic
Tourist Contacts Guide

Inquiry is sent via the guide's preferred contact method (e.g., WhatsApp).

Status: pending_response.

Response Monitoring (Timer)

Wait for 1 min for guide response.

If the guide replies (via any channel), stop escalation.

No Response → Escalate

Auto-send the inquiry to:

Guide’s other contact methods (Email, Messenger, etc.).

If still no response (e.g., after another 2–3 min), escalate to the tour owner.

Tour Owner Notification

Send inquiry details to:

Owner's email/WhatsApp.

Admin panel notification.

Optionally trigger SMS for urgent cases.

Final Fallback

If guide & owner both don’t respond (e.g., within 5 min), escalate to TourWise Admin (your support team) for manual handling.

🏗 How to Implement
DB Structure:
sql
Copy
Edit
inquiries: 
- id
- user_id
- tour_id
- guide_id
- owner_id
- message
- status (pending, escalated_guide, escalated_owner, resolved)
- timestamps
Backend Workflow:
python

# Pseudo-logic
if not guide_response(within=1_min):
    send_to_all_guide_channels()
    if not response(within=2_min):
        notify_tour_owner()
        if not response(within=2_more_min):
            escalate_to_admin()
Notification Methods:
WhatsApp API: Auto-message guide/owner.

Email (SMTP): Send inquiry summary.

In-App Chat: Show red badge to guide/owner dashboards.

Push Notification (optional): If using mobile apps.

🧭 Tourism Use Case Example
Tourist asks about El Nido Island Hopping.

Assigned guide does not respond in 1 min → System pings guide on email/Messenger.

No response in 3 min → Inquiry escalates to Tour Owner.

Owner replies: ✅ Tourist gets answer, booking proceeds.

✅ Benefits
Tourists never feel ignored → boosts trust in TourWise.

Tour owners stay in control of missed inquiries.

Automatic backup ensures bookings are not lost due to guide unavailability.
